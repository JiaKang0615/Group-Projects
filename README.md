# Group & Personal Projects
These are some of the projects I worked in group during the MSBA program and some personal projects I finished earlier.

## Exploratory Analysis on Hillary Clinton's Email
  The data set hosted by Keggle includes Hillary Clinton's released email contents and contacts. The exploration consists of three parts: a) Topic modeling and how topics trending overtime b)How sentiment of emails change on weekdays c)Frequent contacts of Hillary Clinton and network analysis.
  
  As a result of [topic modeling](https://github.com/JiaKang0615/Group-Projects/blob/master/Hillary_LDA_Topic.py) using LDA, 7 topics were identified, and their trend overtime is plotted here.
