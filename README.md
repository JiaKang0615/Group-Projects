# Group & Personal Projects
The following projects were completed during the MS-Business Analytisc program at Carlson School of Management.

### 1. Exploratory Analysis on Hillary Clinton's Email
  This project explores Hillary Clinton's released email contents and contacts. 
  Using **topic modeling, IBM's Waston API** and **R**, the exploration consists of three parts: a)How topics trending overtime b)How sentiment of emails change on weekdays c)Frequent contacts of Hillary Clinton and network analysis.
  
  * As a result of [topic modeling](https://github.com/JiaKang0615/Group-Projects/blob/master/Hillary%20Clinton%20email/Hillary_LDA_Topic.py) using **LDA**, 7 topics were identified, and their trend overtime is plotted here.

  * I detected the [most frequent contacts](https://github.com/JiaKang0615/Group-Projects/blob/master/Hillary%20Clinton%20email/Hillary_Sender_Receiver.R) Hillary emailed with, and visualized the interactions with this chord gram.

  * To do **sentiment analysis**, [IBM's Waston API](https://github.com/JiaKang0615/Group-Projects/blob/master/Hillary%20Clinton%20email/Hillary_email_API.py) was called. It turns out that on Monday, emails tend to be more negative than positive whereas on Friday, positive emails increase.


### 2. SEO strategy for AirFrance
  This project optimized the bidding strategy on Search Engine using the data from AirFrance Case Study. 
  Using **Excel, JMP**, I built **OLS models** for each keyword on each advertisement platform to predict a reasonable rank as target position. The KPIs used to measure advertisement and bidding strategy effect include *Click Through Rate, Conversion Rate, Net Revenue and ROA*.
  As a result, according to the analysis, the ROA increased **40%**.


### 3. Analysis of English Words Using Google N-Gram data
  This project analysis the change of English word usage following the method in the research paper [*Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books*](http://www.librarian.net/wp-content/uploads/science-googlelabs.pdf). 
  I extracted [Google n-gram data](https://github.com/JiaKang0615/Group-Projects/blob/master/Google%20n-gram%20analysis/Hive%20code%20for%20culturomic%20analysis.sql) on **AWS public S3 bucket using Hive**, to analyze the [linguistic change of English words](https://github.com/JiaKang0615/Group-Projects/blob/master/Google%20n-gram%20analysis/processing_data_culturomic_analysis.R). I came to the same conclusion as the research paper, that the process of English verb past tense regularity is ongoing. 

### 4. Using D3.js to Build a Data Visualization Page
  I built a [data visualization page](https://github.com/JiaKang0615/Group-Projects/blob/master/Chinese%20Tourism%20Industry.html) to show intuitivelly how the Chinese Tourism Industry developed over years (the contents is in Chinese). The charts were written using **D3.js** package while the main frame of the page was in **HTML5 and CSS**.

### 5. Design Entityâ€“Relationship Model for ESPN Cricket
  This project redesigned a normalized database into data warehouse. 
  I consolidated 11 highly normalized data files into a data warehouse with star schema structure. After designing the **ER Model**, I used **SQL** to creat tables and their relationship, then performed **data ETL** task to load the data from source files to SQL Server.

### 6. Analysis of Unemployment Rate and Campus Crime Rate
  The project statistically evaluates the likelihood impact of unemployment rate on the campus crime rates. 
  I adopted a probabilistic method and built **hypothesis testings** to measure the effect of unemployment rate of the community on campus crime rate. [The analysis](https://github.com/JiaKang0615/Group-Projects/blob/master/Unemployment%20vs.%20campus%20crime%20rate.py) was done using **Python**.
